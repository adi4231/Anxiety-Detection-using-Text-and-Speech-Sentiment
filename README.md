# Anxiety Detection Using Speech Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to detect anxiety based on speech analysis. By extracting speech features and performing sentiment analysis, the model identifies patterns that indicate anxiety in an individual's speech.

## Features
- **Speech Processing**: Extracts key acoustic and linguistic features from audio recordings.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of speech using NLP techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes various ML algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Deep Learning for classification.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Supports real-time anxiety detection from live audio inputs.
- **Visualization**: Displays speech and sentiment-based insights using data visualization techniques.

Usage
